# Project Decisions Log

## 2026-01-19

### Notes Tab completion

- Added a responsive Notes tab layout with mobile tabs for Folders, Notes, and Editor to match the Tasks tab behavior.
- Implemented desktop toggle buttons to show/hide the folders and notes list panels, using the existing UI slice state.
- Added folder and smart folder creation dialogs and wired them to the existing RTK Query APIs.
- Implemented smart folder filtering using `filters.tags` and `filters.operator` to match the database schema.
- Improved Note editor tag management with an autocomplete UI and a batch tag update mutation.
- Synced notes panel open/close state and widths with user preferences, aligning with existing preference sync patterns.
- Replaced notes list "New Note" buttons with a QuickTaskInput field that always shows and creates notes in the current context.

### Assumptions

- Smart folder filters are stored as `{ tags: string[], operator: "any" | "all" | "none" }`, based on the schema defaults.
- Creating tags for notes can use the default color `#6b7280` when no color is specified.

### Follow-ups

- If category selection for tasks is still required, clarify the desired data model and UI entry points before implementation.

### Workout program save behavior

- Updated workout program save logic to upsert sections, days, and exercises instead of deleting all sections on each save.
- Preserved exercise IDs during updates so `WorkoutSetCompletion` records remain intact for current and past workouts.
- Added targeted cleanup to remove only sections/days/exercises that were explicitly removed in the builder.

### Lint warning cleanup

- Removed unused dependencies from calendar drag handlers to satisfy hook linting.
- Replaced debug log with a warning to comply with console lint rules.
- Refactored dump/restore helper logic to reduce nesting depth.

### History workout cell modal

- Changed workout cells in `HistoryTab` to open the same completion editor modal used for other task types.
- Added an optional "Open Workout" button to the completion editor for workout tasks, which opens the workout modal for the clicked date.
- Routed workout modal opening through `useDialogState` and set the view date so the workout modal loads the correct day’s completion data.
