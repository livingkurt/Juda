# Fix Linting

Could you fix the linting for these linting issues.
Please opt for removing an unused variable than adding a \_ in front of it
IMPORTANT: DO NOT use ignores when solving linting issues, there should always be a way to solve it without ignoring, the only items you can ignore is console logs if they are necessary and not for debugging
